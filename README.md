# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather forecast dashboard that shows the current and future weather of any city in the United States. For this project, I needed to create a form that would allow for a city to be searched. Once the city was searched, that city was to be added to a search history list so it could be clicked and accessed later. The search history buttons needed to persist when the refresh button was hit. For each city, the current weather as well as the forecast for the next 5 days needed to display. For these days, the temperature, wind speed, humidity, weather icon, and date needed to be displayed. For the current weather, the city's name also needed to be displayed. Each city that was searched for needed to be added to the search history list after the previously searched city.
